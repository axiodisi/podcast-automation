  <item><title>Unmasking the Machine: ActBlue Exposed</title><description>Dive into the belly of the beast with "Unmasking the Machine: ActBlue Exposed." Join Jenny, Molly, and the ever-passionate Bob as they dissect the explosive allegations surrounding ActBlue and its donation scandals, including contributions from beyond the grave! Are these platforms the lifeline of grassroots movements, or are they cleverly crafted channels for the puppet masters pulling the strings? As investigations unfold in 20 states, our hosts debate the true scale of corruption and its implications for political figures like Kari Lake. This episode challenges listeners to question the integrity of donation systems and explore whether systematic overhaul or leadership reform is the answer. Can we rebuild trust, or is the system too fundamentally broken? Gear up for a controversial conversation that pulls no punches and demands accountability. Is this the beginning of a political reckoning or just another chapter in the book of political theater?
