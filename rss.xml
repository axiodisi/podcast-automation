            <description>Dive into the provocative world of international politics in our latest episode, &quot;Trump, Ukraine, and the Cost of Intervention.&quot; What happens when former President Trump blames Ukrainian leader Zelensky for Russia's shocking invasion? Is it audacious rhetoric or a valid point? Join Jenny, Bob, and Molly as they untangle this web of geopolitical tension, NATO expansion fears, and the effectiveness of U.S. foreign policy. Debate rages over moral responsibility versus strategic interest—does protecting democracy justify risking another endless war, and at what cost? With tensions as fraught as the Cold War and sanctions failing to deter Russia, we're faced with high-stakes decisions that could alter the future of global stability. Can the U.S. uphold its ideals without being drawn into another foreign entanglement—or are we doomed to repeat the past?</description>
